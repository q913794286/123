#What is Raneto?

Raneto is a Knowledgebase platform for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that uses static
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) files to power the knowledgebase.

Raneto can be called a "static site generator" of sorts as it doesn't require a database. All
of your content is stored in the `content` folder in Markdown (`.md`) files and the entire
knowledgebase structure and content is generated by Raneto. This is good because it's:

* **Simple:** You can create and manage an entire knowledge base using your favorite text editor
* **Flat:** Raneto is a "flat file" CMS, meaning no database woe's, no MySQL queries, nothing
* **Fast:** Raneto is seriously lightweight and doesn't use a database, making it super fast

Raneto also features:

* [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io) for easy templating
* Responsive default template (powered by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com))
* [Highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org) code syntax highlighting
* Full-text search powered by [Lunr](http://lunrjs.com)
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
